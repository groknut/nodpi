**nodpi** is a utility designed to bypass DPI (Deep Packet Inspection). It is a fork of [NoDPI](https://github.com/GVCoder09/NoDPI).

**What makes our version different:**
1. Program configuration via JSON configuration files
2. Modular file structure (not just a single `main.py` file as in the original repository)
3. Added `start.bat` file for quick program launch

**Planned features:**
1. Redesign the project logo (both `.ico` and `.png` formats)
2. Rewrite the `Dockerfile` for better compatibility with the utility
3. Create build instructions from source code
4. Create running instructions from source code
